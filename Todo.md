enclose big code sections in the main function as methods in relevant classes

- [x] sending birthday mail
- [x] reading from file and creating the list of recipients
- [x] remove des from personal friend
- [ ] test to see if this works after removing designation from personal friends
- [ ] merge this to authenticate fromfile and into main

note: maybe return all recipients, pass that as argument and then get birthday recipients.
